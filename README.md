# Black Hole Time Dilation & Redshift Explorer

> **Preface.** I‚Äôm not a physics student and I don‚Äôt fully understand every concept here. This project is my way of learning by building. If you spot mistakes, have insight, or ideas to improve the explanation or the code, please open an issue or PR.

## üåå What is this?

An interactive, browser-based demo showing how **time** and **light** behave near a non-spinning black hole.  
You control the radius \(r\) (in units of the Schwarzschild radius \(R_s\)) with a slider:

- A **Near Clock** (on a planet near the black hole) ticks slower than a **Far Clock** (observer at infinity).
- The planet‚Äôs **color shifts** toward red as gravitational redshift grows.
- Optional **orbit mode** adds the time-dilation effect of a circular orbit (gravity **+** velocity).

Inspired by the ‚ÄúMiller‚Äôs Planet‚Äù sequence in *Interstellar*.

## üñºÔ∏è Features

- **Big black hole** (simple black disk) and **tiny blue planet** that slides along a track with the radius slider.
- **Two clocks**: Far vs Near, updating in real time according to the chosen \(r\).
- **Live readouts**: \(R_s\), \(r\), total time-dilation factor \(\gamma\), redshift \(z\), and (in orbit mode) local \(v/c\).
- **Redshift visualization**: planet (and a color chip) shift from blue ‚Üí red as \(z\) increases.
- **Orbit mode (optional)**: uses the GR circular-orbit formula for total time dilation.
- **Reset** button for clocks.
- **Info panel** - self explanatory.

## üöÄ Quickstart

1. Clone/download this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser. (No build step, no npm‚Äîjust vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.)
3. Drag the **Radius** slider. Watch the Near Clock change and the planet color shift.
4. Toggle **Include orbital motion** to add velocity time dilation for circular orbits.

---

## üéõÔ∏è Controls

- **Radius (r / R‚Çõ)** ‚Äî distance from the black hole in units of \(R_s\).  
  Moves the planet horizontally in the scene and drives all physics.
- **Include orbital motion (circular orbit)** ‚Äî when ON, uses the total GR time-dilation factor for circular geodesics.
  - Shows **Stable / Unstable / No circular orbit** badges depending on \(r\).
  - Displays **\(v/c\)** (local orbital speed as seen by a hovering observer at the same \(r\)).
- **Reset clocks** ‚Äî sets both clocks to 00:00:00.
- **Info (i)** ‚Äî opens an explanation panel.

## ‚öõÔ∏è Physics Overview

We assume a **Schwarzschild** (non-spinning) black hole with mass \(M\). The **Schwarzschild radius**:
\[
R_s \;=\; \frac{2GM}{c^2}.
\]

In the UI, you set \(r\) in units of \(R_s\) (i.e., \(r = \text{(slider)} \times R_s\)). A far-away observer‚Äôs coordinate time is \(t\); a local clock‚Äôs proper time is \(\tau\).

### 1) Gravitational time dilation (static emitter)

For a clock **hovering** (static) at radius \(r\),
\[
\boxed{\;\gamma_{\text{static}}(r) \;=\; \frac{dt}{d\tau} \;=\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{\,1-\frac{R_s}{r}\,}} \;}
\]
and the local clock ticks as \( d\tau = dt / \gamma_{\text{static}} \).

### 2) Gravitational redshift (static emitter)

Light sent from radius \(r\) to infinity is redshifted by
\[
\boxed{\;1 + z_{\text{static}}(r) \;=\; \gamma_{\text{static}}(r) \;=\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{\,1-\frac{R_s}{r}\,}} \;}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad z_{\text{static}} = \gamma_{\text{static}} - 1.
\]
We map \(z\) to a color so the planet grows redder as it approaches the black hole.

### 3) Circular orbits (total time dilation vs infinity)

For a **circular geodesic** at radius \(r\) in Schwarzschild spacetime (equatorial plane), the **total** time-dilation factor (gravity + velocity) relative to infinity is:
\[
\boxed{\;\gamma_{\text{orbit}}(r) \;=\; \frac{dt}{d\tau} \;=\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{\,1 - \frac{3R_s}{2r}\,}} \;}
\]

**Existence & stability:**
- **No timelike circular orbits** for \( r \le \tfrac{3}{2}R_s \) (that‚Äôs the **photon sphere**).
- **Unstable** circular orbits for \( \tfrac{3}{2}R_s < r < 3R_s \).
- **Stable** circular orbits for \( r \ge 3R_s \) (ISCO at \(3R_s\)).

When **orbit mode** is ON, the Near Clock uses \( d\tau = dt / \gamma_{\text{orbit}} \), and the redshift readout uses \( z \approx \gamma_{\text{orbit}} - 1 \) as a **phase-averaged** proxy (see note below).

### 4) Local orbital speed \(v\) as seen by a hovering observer

A static (hovering) observer at the same \(r\) measures the orbiting object‚Äôs local speed as
\[
\boxed{\;\beta_{\text{local}}^2 \equiv \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2
= \frac{\dfrac{R_s}{2r}}{1 - \dfrac{R_s}{r}} \;}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\beta_{\text{local}} = \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{2r\left(1-\frac{R_s}{r}\right)}}.
\]
This is shown as **\(v/c\)** in the UI when orbit mode is ON.
